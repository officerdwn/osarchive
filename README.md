# OS Projects Archive
Archive for my old operating system projects.
Since i have started development of my first ACTUAL Operating System, I decided it would be a good idea to go back and look at other projects.
# Markgold Era
Oh boy, is this a big one, I remember a while back I had a scratch account, and i saw some operating system emulators, so I just took these and retextured them, and did a TERRIBLE job at it too.
Ah, that was an interesting time though. even the NAME was stolen. This line of "operating systems" is long deprecated. Not sure why I stopped developing Markgold OSes, but im glad I did.
