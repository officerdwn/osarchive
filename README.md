# OS Projects Archive
Archive for my old operating system projects.
Since I have started development of my first ACTUAL Operating System, I decided it would be a good idea to go back and look at other projects.
There are other projects, and mini eras, but I am too lazy to cover those.
# Markgold Era (2019-2021?)
Oh boy, is this a big one, I remember a while back I had a scratch account, and i saw some operating system emulators, so I just took these and retextured them, and did a TERRIBLE job at it too.
Ah, that was an interesting time though. even the NAME was stolen. This line of "operating systems" is long deprecated. Not sure why I stopped developing Markgold OSes, but im glad I did.
Interesting thing about 81, I was going to make it paid. Can you believe that?

	Markgold classic (not sure what this is, retextured windows project)  : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/381816375/fullscreen/
 	Markgold Wista (Windows vista scratch emulator retextured, although i did remove the taskbar): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/381496620/
  	Markgold Server 2020 (windows server 2008 scratch emulator retextured): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/381860909/fullscreen/
	Markgold Windows 9 AE (retextured windows 9 joke project?) : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/382198293/fullscreen/
 	Markgold 10.1 (Original project i retextured): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/382237503/fullscreen/
  	Markgold 81 (HTML project of Windows 8, you guessed it, retextured): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRYyJD1sJb9Z_xjVGUe1cZwklcz86bsv
	Markgold Black (Windows 7 scratch project, probably named blac because of MS's internal codename for 7.): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/380711354/fullscreen/
 	Markgold 10: Unrecoverable at the moment, will look into
# Levathon Era (2021-2022)
This era was probably one of the most original eras yet. This era had a lot of batch operating systems. 
I currently cannot recover any, but i will look into such. I stopped developing in this era, due to the founding of Toast Maker Studios. 
  	LevathonOS: Currently lost
   	Levathon NEXT(April fools prank, name inspired off of windows 11 build naming): Currently lost
   	Levathon 1.0: Currently lost
# officerdownOS Batch Era (2023-2024)
These builds are hosted on Github. This UI was based heavily on Levathon 1.0's UI. Also batch. (Archived, development stopped.)

# officerdownOS Era (2024-current)
This era is the most recent and most innovative era of all. These builds are actually bootable, and are in active development.
I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the officerdownOS-batch UI ported to a bootable interface, And i did such back in January, with the help of fdipilla's hello-world-os (Thanks!).
Although this is a fork of an OS, and I have used a lot of AI for this project, I am taking a break to actually learn C, so I don't have to rely on AI.

 	officerdownRTOS(for my Arduino board gifted to me back in december, will start working on it after i get a good basis for the main OS): planned
