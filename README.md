# OS Projects Archive
Archive for my old operating system projects.
Since I have started development of my first ACTUAL Operating System, I decided it would be a good idea to go back and look at other projects.
There are other projects, and mini eras, but I am too lazy to cover those.
# Markgold Era (2019-2021?)
Oh boy, is this a big one, I remember a while back I had a scratch account, I had one because of a school camp using it 
to make "video games" and a year later i was on it, and i saw some operating system emulators, so I just took these and retextured them, and did a TERRIBLE job at it too.
Ah, that was an interesting time though. even the NAME was stolen. This line of "operating systems" is long deprecated. Not sure why I stopped developing Markgold OSes, but im glad I did.
Interesting thing about 81, I was going to make it paid. Can you believe that?

 	Markgold 10: Unrecoverable at the moment, will look into
# Levathon Era (2021-2022)
This era was probably one of the most original eras yet. This era had a lot of batch operating systems.
I stopped developing in this era, due to the founding of Toast Maker Studios.

# officerdownOS Batch Era (2023-2024)
These builds are hosted on Github. This UI was based heavily on Levathon 1.0's UI. Also batch. (Archived, development stopped.)

# officerdownOS Era (2024-current)
This era is the most recent and most innovative era of all. These builds are actually bootable, and are in active development.
I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the officerdownOS-batch UI ported to a bootable interface, And i did such back in January, with the help of fdipilla's hello-world-os (Thanks!).
